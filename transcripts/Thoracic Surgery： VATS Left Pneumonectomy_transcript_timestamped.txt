[0:00] The following is a left vats pneumonectomy performed at the Cleveland Clinic by Dr.
[0:09] Daniel Raymond.
[0:18] The patient is a 67-year-old female never smoker who presented with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections requiring repeated hospitalizations.
[0:27] A bronchoscopy performed in an outside hospital revealed an obstructive distal left main stem mass.
[0:36] She was transferred to the Cleveland Clinic for further evaluation.
[0:45] In retrospect, the mass was seen on scans for several years.
[0:54] A CT scan reveals an obstructive mass at the distal left main stem bifurcation leading to obstructive atelectasis of the upper lobe.
[1:03] In hindsight, one can see suggestion of this mass dating back five years on a prior CT.
[1:12] Bronchoscopy performed at the Cleveland Clinic again revealed an obstructing distal left main stem mass.
[1:22] An aggressive debridement was performed, revealing ultimately a typical carcinoid neoplasm.
[1:31] And a bronchial ultrasound assessment of the paratracheal lymph nodes revealed no evidence of neoplasm.
[1:40] Notably, there is extension of tumor down both the upper and lower lobe segmental bronchi with direct involvement of the secondary carina, thus making a sleeve resection not possible.
[1:49] Additional evaluation revealed an FEV1 of 1.05, which was 49% predicted, and a DLCO of 13.98, which was 70% predicted.
[1:58] Quantitative perfusion scan revealed only 10% perfusion to the left lung.
[2:07] Stress echocardiogram revealed a fixed defect in the inferior wall with no inducible ischemia and a normal EF.
[2:16] An ultimate decision was made to proceed with left pneumonectomy.
[2:25] The case is performed with general endotracheal anesthesia and a right-sided double lumen tube.
[2:34] No epidural is utilized due to a planned VATS approach.
[2:44] The larger red arrow indicates the location of the camera port from which most vantage points of the remaining case will be seen from.
[2:53] The smaller green line, morcephalad, represents a fourth inner space working port, which will have a wound protector placed through it.
[3:02] The smaller blue arrow, inferiorly, is the second working port, which is roughly even with the camera port posterior infrascapular line.
[3:11] The case has begun with a camera port in the posterior axillary line, roughly eighth inner space.
[3:20] We are now obtaining the second more lateral port in the infrascapular line.
[3:29] We are now placing the fourth inner space working port in the posterior axillary line, directly superior to the camera port.
[3:38] One can see adhesions from the chronically atelectatic and infected upper lobe due to the chronic obstruction.
[3:47] Once a soft tissue retractor has been placed in the anterior superior working port, we begin a fairly tedious dissection of the anterior and medial adhesions.
[3:57] This is done with mostly sharp dissection with bovi-electric cautery to obtain hemostasis.
[4:06] We then proceed to mobilize the lung off of the mediastinum.
[4:15] This is done with sharp and blunt dissection and bovi-electric cautery, taking care to preserve the phrenic nerve, which can be easily visualized on the pericardium coming through the center of the screen.
[4:24] Subsequently, we bring up the inferior pulmonary ligament.
[4:33] The lung is now reflected anteriorly.
[4:42] We are taking down adhesions posteriorly between the lung and the aorta and dividing the pleural reflection posteriorly.
[4:51] During this process, we are preserving the vagus nerve.
[5:00] With further dissection inferiorly, we are able to completely circumferentially isolate the inferior pulmonary vein.
[5:09] Subsequently, we circumferentially isolate the superior pulmonary vein.
[5:19] It is then divided with an endo-GI stapler.
[5:28] Next, we circumferentially isolate out the left main pulmonary artery.
[5:37] I place a POTS vessel loop around the artery to assist in placement of an endo-GI stapler.
[5:46] The POTS vessel loop is subsequently removed, and the artery is divided.
[5:55] At this point, one can see the stump of the pulmonary artery at the top of the screen with the aortic arch more distal.
[6:04] The inferior pulmonary vein is visible and has yet to be divided, as does the bronchus.
[6:13] We are now bringing in the endo-GI stapler.
[6:22] To divide the inferior pulmonary vein, this can generally be done from the anterior working port with a roticulated stapler.
[6:32] After additional dissection is performed in the hilum to isolate the left main stem bronchus, we encircle the left main stem bronchus with an endo-GI stapler.
[6:41] The stapler is placed through the posterior inferior port.
[6:50] The retraction is provided by a sponged stick through the working port anteriorly.
[6:59] We try to retract the airway as far as possible in order to minimize the length of the stump.
[7:08] Care has to be taken to avoid injuring the recurrent laryngeal nerve during this process.
[7:17] The specimen is removed with a large endo-catch bag through the anterior working port.
[7:26] We rarely have to enlarge the incision to accommodate the lung, as it is quite deformable.
[7:35] I do tend to divide the intercostal muscle a little further into the chest when I create this working port to allow more compliance of the chest wall.
[7:44] Thank you for watching our video.
