[0:00] This video demonstrates creation of a left upper extremity brachial artery to ulnar artery bypass in a 51-year-old gentleman who presented with critical limb ischemia of the left upper extremity.
[0:08] He previously underwent a left upper extremity brachial to radial artery bypass with cryopreserved vein that thrombosed.
[0:17] Left upper extremity angiogram demonstrated a patent brachial artery in its proximal segment and occluded brachial artery in the mid to distal segment as demonstrated here.
[0:25] Patient was found to have a patent ulnar artery, an occluded radial artery and dominant runoff to the hand via interosseous artery which gave collaterals to the radial artery around the anatomic soft box as demonstrated here.
[0:34] We begin by marking the skin incisions for our proposed brachial artery to ulnar artery bypass.
[0:43] We then made an incision centered just below the antecubital crease.
[0:51] Dissection was carried to the skin and subcutaneous tissue.
[1:00] This incision was centered over the lateral border of pronator teres muscle.
[1:08] Dissection was continued down.
[1:17] Crossing veins were clipped and divided.
[1:26] Crossing veins were also ligated with sutures to allow for better exposure of the ulnar artery.
[1:34] As demonstrated here, the pronator muscle group was retracted medially and the dissection was continued until the ulnar artery was dissected free from surrounding tissue.
[1:43] Retractor was positioned not too deep to avoid injury to median nerve which lies between two heads of pronator group.
[1:51] Once an adequate length of ulnar artery was exposed for our bypass, a vessel loop was passed around the ulnar artery as demonstrated in this video.
[2:00] We then turn our attention to expose the brachial artery.
[2:09] An incision was made in the proximal upper arm medial to the biceps brachial muscles.
[2:17] Dissection is continued through the subcutaneous tissue.
[2:26] Adequate retraction was then placed and dissection is then continued medial to the bicep brachial muscle to expose the brachial artery.
[2:34] Careful dissection is performed to prevent inadvertent injury to the median nerve as demonstrated here.
[2:43] Dissection is then continued on top of the brachial artery until it's dissected free from the surrounding tissue.
[2:52] Next we turn our attention to perform tunneling for this bypass graft.
[3:00] A suprafacial tunnel is then created.
[3:09] A Gore tunneler is used to tunnel between the two incisions as demonstrated here.
[3:17] We decided to use a cryopreserved vein graft for this bypass since the patient had no adequate veins.
[3:26] The vein is marked and is then secured to the tunneler to be pulled through this tunnel in between the two incisions while making sure that the orientation of the vein does not change while it's being pulled through the tunnel.
[3:35] The vein is then flushed with heparinized saline solution as demonstrated here.
[3:43] The vein graft is then beveled for an appropriate size and astimosis between the brachial artery in this cryopreserved vein graft.
[3:52] Proximal control followed by distal control of the brachial artery is obtained.
[4:00] Prior to clamping of the brachial artery the patient is heparinized.
[4:09] An arteriotomy is then made in the brachial artery using an 11 blade.
[4:18] This arteriotomy is then extended with pot scissors.
[4:26] Stage sutures are then placed to allow for visualization during construction of an anastomosis.
[4:35] This is followed by creation of an end-to-side anastomosis between this cryopreserved vein graft and the brachial artery using 6-oproline suture in a running fashion.
[4:43] Once the anastomosis is completed distal brachial artery clamp is removed followed by removal of the proximal clamp and the vein graft is then distended.
[4:52] We then proceed with obtaining proximal and distal control of the ulnar artery.
[5:01] Demonstrated here is the placement of clamp on the distal ulnar artery.
[5:09] This is followed by placement of a proximal ulnar artery clamp.
[5:18] An arteriotomy is then made in the ulnar artery using an 11 blade.
[5:26] This is extended with pot scissors.
[5:35] The graft is then beveled for an appropriate size anastomosis between the ulnar artery and the distal end of the vein graft.
[5:44] Stage sutures are then put in place on the ulnar artery.
[5:52] An end-to-side anastomosis is then constructed between the distal end of this cryopreserved vein graft and the ulnar artery using 6-oproline suture in a running fashion.
[6:01] Prior to completion of the anastomosis the graft is de-aired.
[6:09] Distal clamp is removed first followed by removal of the proximal clamp.
[6:18] While occluding the distal ulnar artery the clamp on the bypass graft itself is then removed.
[6:27] A completion angiogram is then performed that demonstrated no technical errors in the proximal anastomosis good flow to the bypass conduit.
[6:35] It also demonstrated no technical errors at the distal anastomosis between the vein graft and the ulnar artery and predominant runoff via interosseous artery which then reconstituted radial artery at the anatomical snub box.
[6:44] It also provided collateral blood flow to the ulnar artery.
[6:52] This concludes our video demonstration of left brachial artery to ulnar artery bypass in a patient with critical limb ischemia of the left upper extremity with a previous failed bypass.
